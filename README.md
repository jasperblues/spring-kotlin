[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/sdeleuze/spring-kotlin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sdeleuze/spring-kotlin)

**Spring Framework 5 [will provide Kotlin extensions and support builtin](https://spring.io/blog/2017/01/04/introducing-kotlin-support-in-spring-framework-5-0), so this specific library won't be needed for most common Spring + Kotlin features. you can use [this link](https://jira.spring.io/issues/?filter=15463) to see Spring Framework Kotlin related JIRA issues.**

`spring-kotlin` is a repository that contains Kotlin extensions, documentation, and any helpful assets that can help to build Spring + Kotlin applications. This project has been created after [this discussion](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/5537) on Spring Boot issue tracker.

You will find  more information about using Spring Boot + Kotlin in these 3 blog posts:

 - [A Geospatial Messenger with Kotlin, Spring Boot and PostgreSQL](https://spring.io/blog/2016/03/20/a-geospatial-messenger-with-kotlin-spring-boot-and-postgresql)

## Using Spring Kotlin

To use Spring Kotlin extensions, add the following dependency in your `build.gradle` file, with `x.y.z` replaced by the latest release available [here](https://bintray.com/sdeleuze/maven/spring-kotlin/):

```gradle
repositories {
  maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/sdeleuze/maven' }
}

dependencies {
  compile 'org.springframework.kotlin:spring-kotlin:x.y.z'
}
```

## Spring + Kotlin FAQ

### What is the simplest way to start a Spring Boot + Kotlin application?

Go to http://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin, add your dependencies, choose Gradle or Maven and click on "Generate Project" ;-)

### Where this "Configuration problem: @Configuration class 'Foo' may not be final" error message come from?

Spring applications are using proxies to deal with most `@Component` beans like `@Configuration`, `@Service`or `@Repository`. JDK dynamic proxies are used when possible (your bean should implement an interface, and `proxyTargetClass` should be set to `false`, which is the default) while CGLIB proxies are used with classes that do not expose methods with interfaces, and/or when `proxyTargetClass` is set to `true`.

Unlike Java, Kotlin [have made the choice to have a `final` by default behavior](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/classes-final-by-default/166), with `open` keyword used at class or method level to allow extending or overriding them. As a consequence, with CGLIB proxies you need to explicitely specify `open` at class and method level since they require to extend/override the class/methods for technical reasons.

But Kotlin now provides a solution to that issue with the `kotlin-spring` plugin provided with Kotlin 1.0.6+, see [this blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2016/12/kotlin-1-0-6-is-here/) for more information or [spring-boot-kotlin-demo]( https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-boot-kotlin-demo) for a sample project. start.spring.io provide you projects pre-configured with the `spring-kotlin` plugin.

### Why annotation array attributes require `arrayOf()` for single value unlike in Java?

That's a known Kotlin 1.0 issue quite annoying with Spring annotations like `@RequestMapping(method = arrayOf(RequestMethod.GET))`, that will be fixed in Kotlin 1.1, see issue [KT-11235](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-11235) for more details. As a workaround, as of Spring Framework 4.3 / Spring Boot 1.4 you can use annotations aliases like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.

### Why `@Value("${thing}")` does not work with Kotlin?

That's because `$` is used for string interpolation in Kotlin. Workarounds are:
 - Escaping `$`: `@Value("\${some.property}")`
 - Configure `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` to use another `PlaceholderPrefix`
 - Use `@ConfigurationProperties` instead

See [this Stackoverflow response](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33821043/spring-boot-change-property-placeholder-signifier/33883230#33883230) for more details.

### What is the recommanded way to inject dependencies in a Spring Kotlin application

Try [to favor contructor injection](http://olivergierke.de/2013/11/why-field-injection-is-evil/). As of Spring Framework 4.3 / Spring Boot 1.4 you just have to write `class MessageController(val repository: MessageService)` and Spring will automatically autowire the constructor (there should be a single constructor with no default values). For previous versions, you need to write `class MessageController @Autowired constructor(val repository: MessageService)`.

If you really need to use field injection, use `lateinit var`:

```kotlin
@Component
class YourBean {

    @Autowired
    lateinit var mongoTemplate: MongoTemplate

    @Autowired
    lateinit var solrClient: SolrClient
}
```

### How can I get Jackson working correctly with Kotlin classes?
You should register [Jackson Kotlin module](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin). As of Spring Framework 4.3 / Spring Boot 1.4, you just have to add Maven or Gradle dependency and it will be registered automatically. With previous version, you will have to register it manually in one of your `@Configuration` classes:

```kotlin
@SpringBootApplication
open class Application {

    @Bean
    open fun objectMapperBuilder(): Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder =
        Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder().modulesToInstall(KotlinModule())
    
    // ...
```

### How can I get Jackson working correctly with Kotlin Data Classes?
Once you have your [Jackson Kotlin module](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin) registered you can use Jackson annotations. It is pretty straightforward for annotations like `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnoreProperties` but can get more complex when trying to use Jackson field annotations.
Assuming you have a Data Class - Person, that you would serialize to JSON but with snake case convention for field names. In Java you would just use `@JsonProperty("field_name")`. It will not work in Kotlin. Here you have to tell Kotlin compiler that annotation has to be placed on generated getter method 
(as there are no backing fields in Kotlin Data Classes). You do that in the following way:  

```
data class Person(
    @get:JsonProperty("name")
    val name: String,
    
    @get:JsonProperty("last_name")
    val lastName: String,
    
    @get:JsonProperty("year_of_birth")
    val yearOfBirth: Int
)
```

### How can I make my JPA or Spring Data entities immutable?

Use `kotlin-jpa` and/or `kotlin-noarg` compiler plugins as described in this [blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2016/12/kotlin-1-0-6-is-here/).
